# Discordle

Discordle is a recreation of the web based word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) created by Josh Wardle. Discordle has been built to work inside of Discord, a VoIP, instant messaging app, via its bot api which allows for the automation of tasks via code.

This program has been build in [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.13.2, however it should be compatible with node v6.0.0 and newer but it has not been tested.
